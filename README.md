Plugins for EnhancedDiscord

## Tag All:
This plugin is a modification of [CAC27's Tag All](https://github.com/CAC27/Discord-Hax/blob/master/TagAll/) that allows it to work with EnhancedDiscord
>How it works: just type the name of a unpingable role / channel you cant see, EG `@n00bs` and it will fill in the mention

**ISSUES**

- Only works after you have selected a different guild on startup
- If the role has no name, it will spam @'s, making it impossible to mention anyone
